🚀 AI-Based Career Recommender

Project Overview 💡

The AI-Based Career Recommender is an intelligent system that helps users discover the top 5 career paths and relevant courses based on their skills, interests, and proficiency level. This project leverages TF-IDF vectorization and a machine learning model to provide personalized career guidance, helping individuals make informed decisions for their professional growth.

This project was developed as part of my AI/ML internship at IBM SkillsBuild. It demonstrates how AI can bridge the gap between skills and career opportunities.
